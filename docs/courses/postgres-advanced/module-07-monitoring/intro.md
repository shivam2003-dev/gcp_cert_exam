# Module 7: Monitoring, Troubleshooting & Observability

## Overview

You can't fix what you can't see. This module covers monitoring PostgreSQL, understanding metrics, and troubleshooting production issues.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- Key PostgreSQL metrics to monitor
- Using pg_stat_* views effectively
- Setting up Prometheus monitoring
- Reading and analyzing logs
- Query performance debugging
- Replication lag troubleshooting
- Alerting strategies

## Module Structure

1. [Key Metrics](./key-metrics) - What to monitor
2. [pg_stat Views](./pg-stat-views) - Built-in statistics
3. [Prometheus Monitoring](./prometheus) - External monitoring
4. [Log Analysis](./log-analysis) - Reading PostgreSQL logs
5. [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) - Debugging techniques

## Why This Matters

Monitoring is essential for:

- **Proactive issue detection** - Find problems before users do
- **Performance optimization** - Identify bottlenecks
- **Capacity planning** - Understand growth trends
- **Incident response** - Quick diagnosis during outages
- **SLA compliance** - Meet availability targets

:::tip Production Insight
Good monitoring is the difference between catching issues early and discovering them during outages. Invest in monitoring infrastructure.
