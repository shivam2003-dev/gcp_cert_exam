## Learning Approach

This course uses a **practical, exam-focused approach**:

1. **Conceptual Understanding:** Learn what each service does and when to use it
2. **Hands-On Practice:** Use Google Cloud Console and gcloud CLI
3. **Exam Patterns:** Recognize common question patterns and scenarios
4. **Practice Questions:** Test understanding with realistic exam-style questions

:::warning Common Pitfall
Don't just read the content passively. The ACE exam tests your ability to perform tasks, not just recall information. Practice every command and configuration shown in the examples.
:::

## Study Tips

### 1. Active Learning
- Type out every CLI command yourself
- Create resources in Google Cloud Console
- Experiment with different configurations
- Break things and fix them

### 2. Note-Taking
- Create a study guide as you progress
- Note common patterns and "gotchas"
- Document CLI commands you use frequently
- Keep a list of service limits and quotas

### 3. Practice Questions
- Complete all practice questions in each module
- Review answer explanations carefully
- Understand why wrong answers are wrong
- Retake practice questions you got wrong

### 4. Time Management
- Follow the 4-6 week schedule
- Spend 1-2 hours daily on study
- Reserve the last week for practice exams
- Take breaks to avoid burnout

:::note Remember
The ACE exam is associate-level, meaning it tests practical skills, not deep architectural knowledge. Focus on "how to do" rather than "why it works this way."

## Google Cloud Free Tier

To practice hands-on, you'll need a Google Cloud account:

- **Free Tier:** Always free services (with usage limits)
- **Free Trial:** $300 credit for 90 days
- **Always Free:** Limited but permanent free tier

:::tip Exam Tip
Set up billing alerts immediately to avoid unexpected charges. The exam will test your knowledge of billing and cost management.
